- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface

## Technical Architecture

### Library Integration
```javascript
// Enhanced sliders using noUiSlider
this.rateSlider = noUiSlider.create(element, config);

// Professional notifications with SweetAlert2  
Swal.fire({
    icon: 'success',
    title: 'Speech Complete!',
    timer: 2000
});

// Audio visualization with WaveSurfer
this.wavesurfer = WaveSurfer.create({
    container: '#waveform',
    waveColor: '#007bff'
});

// Recording with RecordRTC
this.recorder = new RecordRTC(stream, {
    type: 'audio',
    mimeType: 'audio/wav'
});
```

### Data Persistence
- Voice presets saved in localStorage
- Settings preserved across sessions
- Export/import capability (future feature)
- User preferences remembered

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback functionality for unsupported features
- Graceful degradation

## Security Considerations

### Local Caching Benefits
- No external CDN dependencies at runtime
- Reduced attack surface
- Consistent library versions
- Privacy-focused (no tracking)

### Microphone Permissions
- User consent required for recording features
- Graceful handling of permission denials
- Privacy-conscious implementation
- No audio data transmitted externally
