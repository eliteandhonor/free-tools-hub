## Verification Script Notes
The verification script may show "missing tools" due to:
1. Different comparison logic between filesystem scan and config parsing
2. Timing issues with file system reads
3. Character encoding differences
4. Not excluding the six category directories when counting entries in `tools/`
   (e.g. `find tools -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name calculator ! -name converter ! -name developer ! -name generator ! -name seo ! -name text | wc -l`)
