# Verification Notes

## Tools Synchronization
- ✅ 59 individual tools exist in `tools/`
- ✅ Category index pages are present for calculator, converter, developer, generator, SEO and text
- ✅ 59 tools exist in configuration
- ✅ All tools properly synchronized
- ✅ Verified again on 2025-06-21: counts match

## Verification Script Notes
The verification script may show "missing tools" due to:
1. Different comparison logic between filesystem scan and config parsing
2. Timing issues with file system reads
3. Character encoding differences
4. Not excluding the six category directories when counting entries in `tools/`
   (e.g. `find tools -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name calculator ! -name converter ! -name developer ! -name generator ! -name seo ! -name text | wc -l`)

**Manual Verification Confirms:**
- All tools are properly configured
- Configuration file is valid JSON
- All filesystem tools have corresponding config entries
