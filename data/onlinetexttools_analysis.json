{"extracted_information": "Analysis of the Online Text Tools website based on the provided content:\n\n**Website Structure:**\n- The page follows a standard web page layout with a header, main content area, and footer.\n- Key sections include a main title and description, introductory text about the service, a large list of available tools, sections for upcoming tools (\"Coming Soon\", \"Coming Later\"), feedback/subscription forms, and a detailed footer.\n- Promotional banners (Summer Sale) are present near the top.\n- Navigation links are in the header and repeated/expanded in the footer.\n\n**Tool Categories:**\n- The primary focus is \"Online Text Tools\".\n- Tools are broadly categorized into three main groups on this page: \"All Text Tools\" (currently available), \"Coming Soon\" (tools in development), and \"Coming Later\" (future tools).\n- The website is part of a larger \"Online Tools family\", suggesting other tool categories exist on related sites.\n\n**Interface Design (as described in text):**\n- The user interface for individual tools is described as consistent across all utilities.\n- A specific layout is mentioned for tool usage: \"Simply input your text in the left text area and you'll instantly see the modified results on the right\". This suggests a split-pane or input/output area design.\n- The homepage lists tools with icons (though not rendered in the content), titles, and brief descriptive summaries.\n\n**Navigation Patterns:**\n- **Primary Navigation:** Header menu provides links to All Tools, Features, Pricing, About Us, Sign In, Sign Up.\n- **In-page Navigation:** Links like \"See All Text Tools\" typically anchor to the list of tools on the same page.\n- **Direct Tool Access:** Individual tools are accessed via direct links from the \"All Text Tools\" list (e.g., `/split-text`).\n- **Footer Navigation:** Provides links to Product info (Features, Pricing, About Us), Top Text Tools (a curated list), and Contact information.\n- **Search:** Mention of \"Empty search results\" implies a search function is available, though its placement/prominence isn't explicitly clear on this page content.\n- **Breadcrumbs/Hierarchy:** Not explicitly mentioned or visible in the text structure.\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- Tools work directly in the browser using JavaScript.\n- Client-side processing: \"All conversions and calculations are done in your browser using JavaScript. We don't send a single bit about your input data to our servers. There is no server-side processing at all.\" This is highlighted for privacy and speed.\n- Analytics: Uses Google Analytics and StatCounter (IP address saved on web server for additional analytics).\n- Data Storage: Free plan uses browser local storage for input; Premium/Team plans use cookies for sessions and local storage for input.\n- Developed by Browserling team.\n\n**How Tools are Organized:**\n- Tools are presented as a single, extensive linear list under the heading \"All Text Tools\".\n- Each tool in the list is displayed with its name (linked), and a brief, action-oriented description (e.g., \"Quickly split text into chunks.\").\n- There is no apparent hierarchical categorization or filtering applied directly to the main list on this page content, although the sheer number suggests potential for subcategories.\n- Future tools are clearly separated into \"Coming Soon\" and \"Coming Later\" lists.\n\n**User Experience (as highlighted by the site):**\n- **Simplicity & Ease of Use:** Stressed repeatedly in titles and descriptions.\n- **Speed:** \"Get things done fast\", \"Quickly...\" descriptions for tools, \"instantly get the result\", \"on-the-spot previews\".\n- **Efficiency:** Each tool is optimized for a \"singular purpose\".\n- **Privacy & Security:** Emphasized by client-side processing (data doesn't leave the browser).\n- **Consistency:** Uniform user interface across tools reduces the learning curve.\n- **Comprehensiveness:** \"Hundreds of userfriendly utilities\", \"The Ultimate Text Toolbox!\".\n- **Engagement:** Options to provide feedback and suggest missing tools.\n- **Availability:** Free for personal use, with premium/team plans for commercial use.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {"summer_sale": "50% OFF", "sale_ends_in": "23:34:50 (Timer value from content)", "plans": "Free (personal use), Premium, Team (commercial use)", "access_restriction": "Free plan doesn't use cookies/session info in cookies.
