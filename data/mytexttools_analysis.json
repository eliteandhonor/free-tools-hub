{"extracted_information": "The website MyTextTools.com provides a suite of browser-based text manipulation tools. Its architecture relies heavily on client-side scripting, specifically JavaScript and HTML5, with no server calls occurring during tool usage. The site structure includes a main working area for text input and manipulation, a navigation menu categorized by tool type, and controls for both the working text and individual tools. The UI/UX employs a multi-column layout on larger screens (menu left, controls right, working text and tool controls in the center) and switches to collapsible sections accessed via buttons at the bottom of the page on smaller screens. Local web storage is used for passing the 'working-text' and undo history between different tool pages.", "specifications": {"technical_stack": "Client Side JavaScripting, HTML5, Local Web Storage", "server_interaction": "None during tool usage", "data_persistence": "Local web storage used for passing working-text and undo between tool pages", "server_logs": "Records ip address, date/time stamp, referring page, user agent", "cookies": "Does not use browser cookies itself, but a statistical service loads a third-party cookie"}, "pricing": {}, "features": [], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"copyright_year": "2022"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": [], "tool_organization": {"categories": [{"name": "Basic tools", "tools": ["Count lines, characters, words, sentences, strings.", "Find and replace text.", "Change letter case.", "Remove letter accents.", "Remove unwanted whitespace.", "Sort text by alphabetical, length, random, reverse order."]}, {"name": "Line/item tools", "tools": ["Create/remove line breaks.", "Insert prefix and/or suffix into each line/item.", "Join text lines, side by side.", "Number each line/item.", "Remove blank lines.", "Remove duplicate lines/items.", "Remove lines/items containing specified string.", "Remove unwanted line numbers."]}, {"name": "Column tools", "tools": ["Delete column of text.", "Extract column of text.", "Insert column of text.", "Swap columns of text."]}, {"name": "Generators", "tools": ["Combination generator.", "Numbered list generator.", "Random number generator.", "Random string generator."]}, {"name": "Miscellaneous", "tools": ["Extract text between two strings, tags, characters, etc.", "Extract unique words from text with frequency count.", "On-select tool.", "Text to speech reader.", "English dictionary."]}]}, "ui_ux_patterns": {"layout": "Working-text field above tool controls; Tool menu to the left; Working-text controls to the right (on larger screens).
